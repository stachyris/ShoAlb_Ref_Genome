# *Sholicola albiventris* Reference Genome

## Overview
This repo contains scripts and pipeline for the Reference genome assembly for the Whie-bellied Sholakili *Sholicola albiventris*, an endemic vulnerable species from the Western Ghats of India. Assembly has numerous steps and each of them are numbered and can be found in respective subdirectories. 

## Repo Structure

- **00_scripts** : All scrips used in the manuscript with subdirectories of each process. 

- **01_Figures** : contains the final figures as displayed in the manuscript. ``Figure_{i}.jpg`` are main text figures and ``Figure_S{i}.png`` are supplemental figures. 

- **bShoAlb1.1_Pipeline_Flowchart.pdf** : contains the step by step flowchart depicting the process of assembly and sub-sequent analysis.
